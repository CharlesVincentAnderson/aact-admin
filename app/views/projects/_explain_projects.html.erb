      <p>The AACT database was initially created & deployed in 2010. Since then, dozens of clinical investigators have used it to try to answer questions that can only be answered by studying this body of clinical trial information as a whole. For example, several investigators have analyzed the patterns of compliance with federally mandated reporting regulations. Others have used AACT to better understand the general distribution of clinical trials by phase, type, funding source, sponsor and clinical domain.</p>
      <p>Several of these previous investigations have produced datasets that summarize a collection of trials based on specific criteria. Often the process to collect/develop the datasets required considerable investments of time & effort to query, currate, verify and adjudicate inclusion/exclusion of information.</p>
      <p>We would like to amplify the value of that research that has been conducted. To that end, thorough descriptions of previous research projects and the resulting datasets are being made available in the AACT Projects component.  Previously conducted research projects are listed below. (Click on the project row to see a more detailed description.)</p>
      <p>More important: where possible, project datasets are available as tables in the AACT database so anyone can directly access the information to develop their own queries against it in order to verify the published results or peform entirely new analysis. Each project has its own database schema in AACT which contains all analytic data related to that project. (Note: not all projects listed below have datasets; so not all projects have a corresponding schema in the database. For example, some projects represent websites that use AACT as a backend datasource. Such projects therefore do not have any data to share with the public, therefore they do not have a corresponding database schema. If a project has data available in the AACT database, the schema name in which the data resides is listed in the table under 'DB Schema'.</p>
