      <p class='projectExplanation'>The AACT database was launched in 2010. Since then, dozens of researchers have used it to better understand the state of clinical trials. Many important questions can only be answered by analyzing this relatively complete set of clinical trials data. Several investigators have used AACT to study 'results reporting trends' to determine how compliant the research community has been with federally mandated regulations. Others have used AACT to get an idea of which clinical domains tend to receive the most attention, which appear to be neglected and how specific types of trials are distributed geographically.</p>
      <p class='projectExplanation'>Several AACT-based investigations have produced datasets that are likely useful to others interested in similar topics and those who would like to further analyze or verify the investigations. Often the process to collect & develop the datasets requires the considerable effort of clinicians and informaticists to query, currate, verify and adjudicate inclusion/exclusion of information. These datasets themselves are valuable sources of information.</p>
      <p class='projectExplanation'>To maximize the value of previous efforts, we're making certain datasets available within the AACT database. The previously conducted research projects we have so far pulled included in AACT are listed below. (Click on the plus icon that prefixes each row to see details and get access to downloadable data artifacts related to the project.)</p>A
      <p class='projectExplanation'>Where possible, project datasets are available as tables in the AACT database so anyone can directly access the information and join it to current ClinicalTrials.gov information. Each project has its own database schema in AACT which encapsulated all data specific to that project. Each projectschema includes a data dictionary to help describe the data for that project. Not all projects listed below have datasets saved to the database. For example, some projects are websites that use the AACT database as a backend datasource. Such projects therefore do not have data to share with the public, therefore they do not have a corresponding database schema. If a project has data available in the AACT database, the schema name in which the data resides is listed in the table under 'DB Schema'.</p>
