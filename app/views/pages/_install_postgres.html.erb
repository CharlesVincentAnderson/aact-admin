  <h3 class="stepName">Install <i>PostgreSQL</i> Database Platform</h3>

</div>

<p>The <i>PostgreSQL</i> package (open source and freely available) includes a number of nice tools. If you intend to access the public AACT database hosted in the cloud, the only PostgreSQL tool you need is <%= link_to 'psql', 'http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html' %>. If you would like to download a static copy of AACT to use on your local machine, you'll need the full postgreSQL package including the tools to create and populate the database (createdb & pg_restore). These tools are part of the standard PostgreSQL package, so once installed, you will be able to create your own AACT database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AACT is currently running on version <%= ENV['DB_VERSION'] %> of PostgreSQL; it's recommended you install this version or higher. Refer to <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/download/' target='_blank'>PostgreSQL Downloads</a> for free software and installation instructions.</p>
