 <h3>AACT 4.1.1 <i>(February 16, 2019)</i></h3>

 <h5>Resolve Security Issues Identified by GitHub</h5>
  <p>We upgraded several gems to address security vulnerabilities including: sprockets, loofah & rubyzip. Several other unused gems were removed.</p>

 <h5>Provide More Detailed Description about CDEK Standard Orgs Project</i></h5>
 <p>The CDEK Standard Orgs project description that appears on the <a href='/projects' target='_blank'>Projects page</a> of the AACT website did not define which organizations were reviewed & curated, and did not provide examples. We modified this documentation to better describe this project.</p>

 <h5>Revise Data Dictionary Documentation</h5>
 <h6>Describe Different Schemas</h6>
 <p>We modified summary information on the <a href='/data_dictionary' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary page</a> to better describe schemas recently added to the AACT database.</p>

 <h6>Document Set of 'all_' Views</h6>
 <p>We also added a table that defines a set of undocumented views in the AACT database, all of which have the prefix 'all_'. Information about these views has been documented on the <a href='/data_dictionary#allViewDictionary' target='_blank'>Data Defintions page</a> of the AACT website. These views provide a string that concatenates all the values of a certain one-to-many relationship per study. The values are delimited with a bar character (|). For example, the study NCT00000146 has 3 rows in the browse_conditions table, so the row for this study in the all_browse_conditions view provides this value: 'Multiple Sclerosis|Neuritis|Optic Neuritis' in the name coumn. These views are useful for people who need to extract a spreadsheet of studies where each row represents one study, and the row includes one-to-many data values. More information about these views can be found near the bottom of the <a href='/data_dictionary#allViewDictionary' target='_blank'>Data Defintions page</a> of the AACT website.</p>
