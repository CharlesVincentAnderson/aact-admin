 <h3>AACT 4.1.1 <i>(February 16, 2019)</i></h3>

 <h5>Resolve Security Issues Identified by GitHub</h5>
  <p>To address security vulnerabilities detected by github, we upgraded the sprockets, loofah & rubyzip gems. Several other unused gems were removed.</p>

 <h5>Add Provided_Documents table</h5>
  <p>On February 6, 2019, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) started making information about the documents provided with the study available through their API.  AACT now includes this informationi a table named provided_documents. The NLM briefly describes this information as follows:</p>
  <p class='quotedText'>"Data providers can submit documents including the Study Protocol, Informed Consent Forn (ICF), and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), possibly all in the same pdf document.  These documents are archived, made available through the ClinicalTrials.gov site, and are now described in the Public XML."</p>

 <h5>Provide More Detailed Description about CDEK Standard Orgs Project</i></h5>
 <p>The CDEK Standard Orgs project documentation that appears on the <a href='/projects' target='_blank'>Projects page</a> did not note that the set of organizations included in the AACT database are those identified as the sponsor, overall official or responsible party of interventional drug trials. We have modified this documentation to better describe this project.</p>

 <h5>Revise Data Dictionary Documentation</h5>
 <h6>Describe Different Schemas</h6>
 <p>We modified summary information on the <a href='/data_dictionary' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary page</a> to better describe the schemas recently added to the AACT database.</p>

 <h6>Document Set of 'all_' Views</h6>
 <p>We added a table that defines a set of views in the AACT database that had previously been undocumented, all of which have the prefix 'all_'. Information about these views is now available on the <a href='/data_dictionary#allViewDictionary' target='_blank'>Data Defintions page</a>. These 'all_ views' provide concatenated value strings for various one-to-many study relationships. The values are delimited with a bar character (|). For example, the study NCT00000146 has 3 rows in the browse_conditions table, so one row for this study is in the all_browse_conditions view that provides this value: 'Multiple Sclerosis|Neuritis|Optic Neuritis'. These views are useful for those who need to export a spreadsheet of studies where each row represents one study, and the row includes one-to-many data values. More information about these views can be found near the bottom of the <a href='/data_dictionary#allViewDictionary' target='_blank'>Data Defintions page</a>.</p>

 <h5>User Table Restore Instructions: Include Note to Escape Single Quotes</h5>
 <p>Some users have a single quote in their last name. When restoring the Users table, the restore function will become confused and abort unless these single quotes are escaped. We have updated the instructions to remind the administrator to escape all single quotes that appear in user names before running the restore command.</p>
